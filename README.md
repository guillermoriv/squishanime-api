# squishanime-api
API for substracting anime information and episodes from websites like (monoschinos and tioanime), right now we have support for two pages

* [monoschinos2](https://monoschinos2.com/)
* [tioanime](https://tioanime.com/)

# How to install?
This is a Node.js based API, to install you have either **yarn** or **npm**. (I used **yarn** for this project, feels like more easy to use than npm).

<pre>yarn install</pre>

To install all the packages used by the API.

# How to use?
If you already have all the packages installed, you should have also set up your **.env** variables.

<pre>yarn dev</pre>

Should be the next command to initializate the project.
